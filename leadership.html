  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>The name “Onsen” was inspired by a moment of reflection during a period of intense operational and strategic pressure. After visiting a traditional Japanese onsen — a space designed for restoration and reset — it became clear that the most effective leaders are not those with the fewest challenges but those who know where to find clarity in the midst of them.</p>
  <p>Our approach combines deep cross-border experience, technical fluency, and boardroom judgment to help clients move from pressure to precision. Clients leave not just with strategy, but with renewed focus, confidence, and alignment.</p>
  <p><strong>When the stakes are high, Onsen Global is where power meets precision.</strong></p>
